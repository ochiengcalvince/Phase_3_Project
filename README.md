###   Overview
In our analysis, we explored the data which was collected during the National 2009 H1N1 survey and build a multiple linear regression model with some of the features stipulated in the dataset. From there, we analysed the results and came to a conclusion on the following factors that have a significant impact on people's decisions to get vaccinated or not.

    * age_group
    * education
    * race
    * sex
    * employment_status
 * Opinions on H1N1 vaccine and seasonal flu vaccine.

 ### 1 Business Understanding
 Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses
 that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease (known as flu season) almost every winter in the United States. Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics, i.e., global epidemics of flu disease.
